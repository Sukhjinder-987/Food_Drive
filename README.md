# Food_Drive
The Edmonton City Food Drive Project aims to make the best use of machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency and impact of the food drive in Edmonton, Alberta which will support the local food bank of Edmonton to address the food insecurity in the community. This could be achieved by optimizing the volunteer route assignment and maximizing collection effectively.

Problem Statement: - The challenges faced by the Edmonton Food Drive are the route planning, pick-up processes, and drop-off locations. Therefore, there is a need to optimize the Edmonton Food Drive by providing better solutions for collecting donated food by enhancing the route planning. There are a limited number of volunteers, so it is necessary to employ them efficiently in areas of greater requirement.
