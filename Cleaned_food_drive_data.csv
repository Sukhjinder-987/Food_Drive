The maps for the routes need addresses (at least around the borders of the route) as I don't know how to read maps very well & so that people are not doubling up on the houses (some of the houses my route already has bags in their mailboxes),Greenfield Ward
via Email,Riverbend Stake Centre,Riverbend Stake,1 Hour - 1.5 Hours,3,0,121,45,No,1,Positive,"We need to give people more time to go shopping to get food for donations - that was a comment that I received from multiple people. 
Another comment I got was that the bags are small.  (Not everyone was that generous, but some people had filled up the bag to the top).
As someone picking up bags I found that the brown paper bag blended into people's doorsteps and was hard to see.  The old plastic bags were better, but if you need to use paper then maybe get them colored bright orange, yellow or blue.  
The person helping me deliver bags had trouble with the map (it really isn't very good) and ended up doing part of someone else's route (I let my coordinator know so the other person didn't double up bags on people's steps).  Maps could be a lot better, they need more details.  
Note - according to the map there were more doors than I delivered to, some were 'No Soliciting' and some I just didn't get to because of time and also because I knew from previous experience that people in those areas didn't participate.  (Sorry, I have arthritic knees and I did what I could which is more than last year, no one did my area in 2023).",Terwillegar Park Ward
